# Dungeon-Game

This project takes a text file from the user with the number of loadable objects the user would like on their game map.
The user can put items in their inventory or on the map, and then make creatures to place onto the map and the coordinates 

The project will then output the map as well as the users inventory.

If the file does not exsist or is not formatted correctly it will tell the user why and throw an exception
